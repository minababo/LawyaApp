# 🛠️ Lawya Admin Panel

This folder contains the **web-based admin interface** for the Lawya project — a platform that connects clients in rural Sri Lanka with verified lawyers for remote legal consultations.

The admin panel is built using **React + TypeScript** and provides tools for managing lawyer registrations and overseeing platform operations.

The Admin Panel allows system administrators to:

- 🔎 **Review, approve, or reject lawyer registrations**
- 📜 **View uploaded qualification documents (e.g., certifications)**
- 🧮 **Filter and sort lawyers by approval status, expertise, NIC, and registration date**
- 🔐 **Securely log in using token-based authentication**
- 📊 *(Planned)* Monitor consultation trends, registration growth, and system statistics

This admin interface was developed as part of our university coursework for **PUSL2021 – Computing Group Project**.
